        A croissant is a buttery, flaky, viennoiserie pastry of Austrian 
        origin, named for its historical crescent shape. Croissants and
         other viennoiserie are made of a layered yeast-leavened dough.

        The birth of the croissant itself‚Äîthat is, its adaptation from 
        the plainer form of kipferl, before the invention of 
        viennoiseries‚Äîcan be dated to at least 1839
         when an Austrian artillery officer, August Zang, founded a
          Viennese bakery ("Boulangerie Viennoise") at 92, rue de
           Richelieu in Paris. This bakery, which served Viennese 
           specialties including the kipferl and the Vienna loaf,
            quickly became popular and inspired French imitators. 
            The French version of the kipferl was named for its crescent 
            (croissant) shape and has become a universally identifiable 
            shape across the world.
